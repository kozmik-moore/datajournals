# datajournals

An old, web-based journaling application of mine.

Built on Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy using an SQLite database and made accessible over a web-browser interface using Bootstrap 5. This is one version of my ongoing journaling projects, meant to support my desire to improve my writing habits and my coding.

I don't consider it usable without some dedicated tweaking and only maintain it as a testament to my growing abilities and ideas (though I may come back to improve this repository in the future ðŸ˜‰).
